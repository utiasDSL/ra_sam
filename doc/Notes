Performance of Batch vs. ISAM or FixedLagSmoother
1. Note that the performance of smoothers is identical to that of the batch only in 'retrospect'. 
    The posterior estimates after optimization of a subgraph will not be equal to that of the
    batch estimate. Only after the smoother has solved for the entire trajectory will the 
    posterior be equal to that of the batch. 
2. At what point does vertex_0, stop being influenced (or influence) by vertex_100.

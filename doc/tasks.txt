1. Verify that IMU preintegration is working correctly on nominal data (done)
Result: With nominal data, the results are as expected

2. Figure out timing. Timing is not accurate yet.

3. Smoother traj length greater than 1 does not work with VIO as input (Sometimes).
This perhaps related to odometry preintegration. Specifically, the solver gets stuck
at update method of gtsam.

4. Fix covariance propagation in odometry integrator.
